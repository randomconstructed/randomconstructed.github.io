### Taking constructed back to a time with no net decking

Constructed got less challenging when net decking (looking up well tested decks online) became possible... Random Constructed is a format that attempts to make constructed more interesting, taking it back to the good old days where you had to innovate.

It does this be picking 3 random sets at random each week to form a deck building card pool. Similar to the sealed limited format, this format is designed to be use once. Everytime you rebuild based on past experience is an advantage you have on others. Meet with your friend IRL or online and challenge them once a week!

Randomness comes from the hash of the first Bitcoin Cash block mined after noon on Sunday. The new week's format is locked in from 4pm GMT on Sunday and lasts exactly one week. Find this week's sets on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RandomConst).

The number of combinations of 3 sets from the current 95 in the [set list](https://github.com/randomconstructed/randomconstructed/blob/master/sets.csv) is 138415. This means that you're presented with a unqiue deck building envionment each week.

### What do you with these sets now?

1) Paste the link generated for you above into a browser to view and search the card pool.

2) Use a deck building site/program to build a deck of 60 cards minimum with a maximum of 4 of each card. There is no ban list.

3) Play online or IRL against others you want to play the same format. If playing IRL you might need to [make some proxies]( http://mtgpress.net) unless you collection is extensive ;)
