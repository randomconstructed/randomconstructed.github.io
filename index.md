### Taking constructed back to a time with no net decking

Constructed got less challenging when net decking (looking up well tested decks online) became possible... Random Constructed is a format that attempts to make constructed more interesting, taking it back to the good old days where you had to innovate.

It does this be picking three random sets at random each week to form a small card pool from which to build decks from. Similar to the sealed limited format, this format is designed to be a used once. Everytime you rebuild based on past experience is an advantage you have on others. Meet with your friend IRL or online and challenge them once a week!

Randomness comes from the hash of the first Bitcoin Cash block mined after noon on Sunday. The new week's format is locked in from 4pm GMT on Sunday and lasts exactly one week. A new tweet is posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RandomConst) when the sets change. 

The number of combinations of 3 sets from the current 95 in the [set list](https://github.com/randomconstructed/randomconstructed/blob/master/sets.csv) is 138415. This means that you're presented with a unqiue deck building envionment each week.

Happy building!
